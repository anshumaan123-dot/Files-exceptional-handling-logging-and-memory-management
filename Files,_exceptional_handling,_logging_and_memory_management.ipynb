        "- Interpreted languages are easier for quick development and testing.\n",
        "- Compiled languages are more efficient for performance-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to gracefully deal with errors that occur during the execution of a program.\n",
        "- Instead of crashing the program, Python allows you to catch and handle these errors using specific blocks of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The \"finally\" block in Python is used to define a section of code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen during program execution. It helps in Debug issues, Monitor program behavior, Record errors and warnings, Save information for later analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The \"__del__\" method is a special method in Python, also known as a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed, usually when its reference count drops to zero (i.e., no more references to it exist).\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- 1. import module Imports the entire module. You must use the module name to access any function, class, or variable from it.\n",
        "- 2. from module import name Imports a specific function, class, or variable from a module. You can use it directly without the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " 1. Using a Tuple in a Single except Block\n",
        " 2. Using Multiple except Blocks\n",
        " 3. Catching All Exceptions\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement in Python is used to simplify file handling and ensure that resources like files are automatically closed, even if an error occurs during file operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Both multithreading and multiprocessing allow concurrent execution, but they differ in how they handle tasks and use system resources.\n",

        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",

        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python refers to how the language allocates, uses, and frees memory during the execution of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " 1. Write code inside a try block\n",
        " 2. Handle exceptions using one or more except blocks\n",
        " 3. Optionally use an else block\n",

        " 4. Supports Dynamic Typing and Object Creation\n",
        " 5. Ensures Stability and Reliability\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- try Block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "- except Block catches and handles the exception raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python’s garbage collection (GC) is an automatic process that frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed by the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The code inside the else block runs only if no exception was raised in the try block. It is useful for code that should run only when the try block succeeds without errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- Python’s logging module defines several standard logging levels to categorize the importance or severity of log messages. These levels help filter and manage log output effectively DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() is a low-level Unix system call that duplicates the current process.\n",
        "- multiprocessing is a high-level Python module that abstracts process creation and communication and works cross-platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " 1. Frees System Resources\n",

        " 3. Prevents Data Corruption\n",
        " 4. Avoids Unexpected Behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- Use read() when you want to load the whole file at once.\n",
        "- Use readline() when you want to process the file line-by-line, especially useful for large files to save memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module in Python is used to record (log) messages that provide insight into the execution of a program. It helps developers track events, debug issues, and monitor the application’s behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system and perform file and directory operations that go beyond simple reading and writing. It offers functions to manage files and directories at a system level.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Reference cycles : Cyclic references causing memory leaks\n",
        "- Memory overhead\t: Python objects have extra metadata memory\n",
        "- Fragmentation\t: Inefficient memory usage over time\n",
        "- Delayed garbage collection\t: Memory freed only during periodic GC runs\n",
        "- GIL limitations\t: Limits concurrency, affecting resource use\n",
        "- Manual resource cleanup\t: Need explicit management of some resources\n",
        "- Extension leaks\t: External code may leak memory beyond Python’s control\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, you can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword. This is useful when you want to trigger an error intentionally — for example, to enforce input validation or custom error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is important in specific scenarios where a program needs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously or remain responsive while doing background work.\n"
